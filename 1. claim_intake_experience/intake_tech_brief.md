Absolutely! Here’s a **tech brief** and **step-by-step setup commands** for starting your auto insurance claim intake app. This assumes you’re building a modern web/mobile-first frontend—let’s use **React** (with Vite for speed), TypeScript for type safety, and you can connect to your backend later.

---

## Tech Brief

**Overview:**  
You’ll build a mobile-first, modern insurance claim intake app using React and TypeScript. The app will walk users through the multi-step claim process, handling data input, image uploads, and status tracking.

**Front-end Stack:**
- **React** (component-based UI)
- **TypeScript** (type safety)
- **Vite** (fast dev/build)
- **Material-UI** (modern UI)
- **React Router** (for step navigation)
- **Axios** (for API calls)
- **React Hook Form** (for form handling)
- **Yup** (for validation)

**Back-end/Services:**  
(Not covered here, but you’ll later connect to your API endpoints for claim submission, authentication, photo storage, etc.)

**Dev Tools:**
- **VSCode** (IDE)
- **Node.js** & **npm** (JavaScript runtime & package manager)
- **Git** (version control)
- **Homebrew** (for package management, already installed)

## Initial Setup Commands

**1. Install Node.js (if you don’t already have it):**
```sh
brew install node
```

**2. Create a new Vite + React + TypeScript project:**
```sh
npm create vite@latest claim-intake-app -- --template react-ts
cd claim-intake-app
```

**3. Install dependencies:**
```sh
npm install
npm install tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer
npx tailwindcss init -p
npm install react-router-dom axios react-hook-form yup @hookform/resolvers
```

**4. Configure Tailwind (add to `tailwind.config.js`):**
Replace the content field with:
```js
content: [
  "./index.html",
  "./src/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}",
],
```

**5. Add Tailwind to `src/index.css`:**
At the top of `src/index.css`, add:
```css
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;
```

**6. Start the dev server:**
```sh
npm run dev
```

## Next Steps

- Open the folder in VSCode:  
  ```sh
  code .
  ```
- Start laying out your folder structure (`/components`, `/pages`, etc.)
- Start building your multi-step form using React Router and React Hook Form.
