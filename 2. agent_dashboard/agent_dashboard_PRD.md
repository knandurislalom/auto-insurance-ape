# Product Requirements Document (PRD)  
**Agent Dashboard for Auto Insurance Claim Processing**

## Overview
This Agent Dashboard is designed to address the critical pain points faced by claim processors: excessive time spent on claim processing and lack of clear prioritization guidance. The dashboard will provide intelligent automation, risk assessment, and priority-driven workflows to dramatically improve processor efficiency and claim resolution times.

---

## Problem Statement

**Current Pain Points:**
- Claim processors spend excessive time manually reviewing and triaging claims
- No systematic approach to prioritize claims based on urgency, complexity, or risk
- Difficulty identifying high-risk or potentially fraudulent claims early in the process
- Manual processes lead to inconsistent handling and longer resolution times
- Lack of visibility into workload distribution and processing bottlenecks

**Business Impact:**
- Increased operational costs due to inefficient processing
- Delayed claim resolutions affecting customer satisfaction
- Missed opportunities to prevent fraudulent payouts
- Inconsistent claim handling across different processors

---
