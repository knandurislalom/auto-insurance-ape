Absolutely! Here’s a **revised PRD focused specifically on Auto Insurance Intake**. This version narrows the requirements to auto claims, making the POC even more targeted and achievable.

# Product Requirements Document (PRD)  
**POC Scope: Auto Insurance Intake**

## Overview
This Proof of Concept (POC) demonstrates a streamlined auto insurance claims intake and review process. The POC will focus on three core features: a Smart Intake Form for auto claims, Document Upload & Extraction, and a Processor Dashboard.

---

## 1. Smart Auto Claim Intake Form

### Goal
Allow policyholders to quickly and accurately submit auto insurance claims through a dynamic, user-friendly, and error-resistant form.

### Functional Requirements

- **Dynamic Sections**
  - Fields specific to auto claims:  
    - Policy number  
    - Vehicle information (make, model, year, VIN)  
    - Incident details (date, time, location, weather/road conditions)  
    - Description of damage  
    - Other parties involved (names, insurance info)
- **Guided User Experience**
  - Tooltips and inline examples for complex fields (e.g., VIN format, incident description).
  - Progress indicator for multi-section forms.
- **Real-Time Validation**
  - Required fields and format checks (dates, VIN, phone numbers).
  - Suggestions for common errors (e.g., “VIN must be 17 characters”).
- **Photo Prompt**
  - Suggest uploading photos of damage and accident scene.
- **Responsive Design**
  - Usable on both desktop and mobile devices.

### Non-Functional Requirements

- Fast load time (<2 seconds).
- Accessible (WCAG 2.1 AA compliance where feasible).

---

## 2. Document Upload & Extraction

### Goal
Enable claimants to upload supporting documents (e.g., accident photos, police reports), with basic automated data extraction and inconsistency flagging.

### Functional Requirements

- **Document Upload**
  - Supported file types: JPEG, PNG, PDF.
  - File size limit (e.g., 10 MB per file).
  - Upload multiple files at once.
  - Preview thumbnails for images.
- **Basic Extraction**
  - Extract metadata: filename, file type, upload date.
  - Simple OCR on police reports or screenshots to find key info (e.g., date, location, license plate).
- **Inconsistency Flagging**
  - Compare extracted data (e.g., date, license plate) with form entries.
  - Visually flag mismatches for processor review.

### Non-Functional Requirements

- Secure upload (HTTPS).
- Temporary storage for demo purposes.

---

## 3. Processor Dashboard

### Goal
Allow claim processors to efficiently triage and review incoming auto claims.

### Functional Requirements

- **Summary Table**
  - List of submitted auto claims with:  
    - Claimant name  
    - Submission date  
    - Status  
    - Flags for missing info/inconsistencies
- **Claim Detail View**
  - Access to full intake form responses, uploaded documents, and extracted data.
- **Issue Highlighting**
  - Visual indicators for claims with flagged issues or missing required documentation.
- **Prioritization**
  - Sort/filter by submission time, flagged issues, or claim status.

### Non-Functional Requirements

- Dashboard updates in near real-time (auto-refresh every 30s or manual refresh).
- Authentication not required for POC.

---

## Success Metrics

- Users can submit complete auto claims with at least one document/photo.
- At least one claim shows a flagged inconsistency in demo.
- Processors can view, sort, and triage claims via the dashboard.

---

## Out-of-Scope (for POC)

- Other insurance product types (home, medical, etc.).
- Advanced risk scoring or fraud detection.
- Full claimant portal/status tracker.
- Persistent storage beyond demo session.

---

## Open Questions

- Should demo data include both real and synthetic documents?
- Is there a preferred list of required vs optional fields for auto claims?
- What is the minimum set of extraction fields to target for OCR (e.g., date, license plate, location)?
